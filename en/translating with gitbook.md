# Translating with GitBook

GitBook is the website we've been building many of our most recent Sushi Cards on (you're on it now!).

You'll need to register [on the GitBook website](https://www.gitbook.com/join), or login with an existing Google, GitHub, Twitter or Facebook account. Then, email me (**philip@coderdojo.org**) so I can add you as a collaborator on the book.

If you're working on one of these translations, I've sent you some more detailed instructions on exactly which pages to translate. **Please be sure to follow these links.** They'll make sure you're on the right branch when you submit your changes.

Please go check out the [guidelines for translators](guidelines for translation.md) too!

## Save regularly!

The “Publish” button, in the top right of the GitBook editing window will save your changes. Use it regularly! Don't worry about publishing something that's partially finished—Your work is in a branch, so won't be generally visible until we approve that branch.
