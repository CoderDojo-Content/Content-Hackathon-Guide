# What is a Challenge Card?

Challenge Cards are two-sided cards that present the Dojo attendee with a three-stage challenge, of increasing difficulty, in a particular topic area, at a targeted skill level. An example might be the challenge of building a quiz in JavaScript with stages like:

* Normal: Ask the player some questions and  keep score.
* Hard: Use 10 questions from a larger list, with a random order to those questions.
* Ultra: Let the player enter their name and restart the quiz with a different name once finished. Include a high-score table.

They also offer some guidance or assistance, with reference to existing Sushi Cards and other material they may have encountered, but** do not explain exactly how to complete the challenge. **

The aim is to offer attendees who have learned the elements of a language or tool the chance to test and grow their understanding by applying those skills to solving a problem from design through to implementation and testing.
