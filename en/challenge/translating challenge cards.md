# Translating Challenge Cards

Challenge Cards have been created, mostly, as Google Docs. This means that translating them is just a matter of doing the following:

* Go to the Google Doc of the Challenge Card while logged into your own Google account
* Choose `File > Make a copy…` and you'll get a copy in your Google Drive
* Once you've got the copy saved to your drive, **immediately share it with me so you don't forget!** Choose the blue `Share` button in the top right of the screen and share it with **philip@coderdojo.org**, giving me at least the “Can comment” permission.
* Start translating!
