# Creating a Challenge Card

## Choosing your topic

Pick any programing language, or set of languages \(e.g. HTML, CSS and JavaScript\) that you know and pick a challenge that might be interesting to Dojo attendees. Challenges you've already tried at your own Dojo are usually the best choice. **Don't forget to check the **[**list of existing cards**](challenge/existing challenge cards.md)** to make sure your idea hasn't been done already!**

## Using the template

I have created a [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n3Rxz5-AkMfD6Eclkk8mBEEkXCCpKg80D9zsoopmIWA/edit#) in GoogleDocs that you can use to create Challenge Cards. Go to the [template](https://www.gitbook.com/book/philipharney/content-hackathon-guide/edit#) while logged into your Google account and choose `File > Make a copy…`. 

I've left comments in it that explain how all the styling elements work. Don't worry about picking a specific highlight colour for your language. I'll do that once you're finished!

## Sharing with me
Once you've got the copy saved to your drive, **immediately share it with me so you don't forget!** Choose the blue `Share` button in the top right of the screen and share it with **philip@coderdojo.org**, giving me at least the “Can comment” permission.

## Get writing
You've got a topic, a document and it's all setup for sharing with me. Time to get writing! Refer to the existing cards to get an idea of style and the level of detail (it's not much!) that we're looking to have.
