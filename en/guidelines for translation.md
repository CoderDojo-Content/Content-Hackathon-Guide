# Translator Guidelines

## Do
* Try to maintain the tone of the material
* Translate the technical terms to match the way they're used in the destination language
* Remember to translate text strings and variable names in code samples, and keep them consistent
* Ask questions if you're not sure!

## Don't
* Worry about sticking to the precise phrasing or descriptions I've used. Do what seems right for your language and locale.
