# Translator Guidelines

## Do
* Try to maintain the tone of the material
* Translate the technical terms to match the way they're used in the target language
* Follow the links in Sushi Cards/Challenge Cards and, where possible, replace with appropriate resources in the target language
* Remember to translate text strings and variable names in code samples, and keep them consistent
* Ask questions if you're not sure!

## Don't
* Worry about sticking to the precise phrasing or descriptions I've used. Do what seems right for your language and locale.
* Change file names! I'll use these to understand what fits where, so please don't localise them!
