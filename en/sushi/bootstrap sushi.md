# Bootstrap Sushi Cards

If you are working on this project, the aim is to create a set of Sushi Cards based on the popular [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) library, targeted at Dojo attendees who have already completed our Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced HTML & CSS Sushi Cards, but who may have no experience of JavaScript. Therefore, the focus should be on covering the HTML & CSS elements of the library, without addressing the JavaScript components except in passing.

You should aim to include the following, but not limit yourselves to this list:

  * Adding Bootstrap to your website (via CDN links, optionally offline too)
  * The grid system
  * Responsive layout (as a concept, a little example)
  * The navbar component (a simple example, if possible!)
  * Looking up effects/features in the documentation and implementing them on a site
  
We prefer to use tools like [Trinket](https://trinket.io) for web based projects as they offer advantages in ease of setup and persistence of file across machines (i.e. avoiding loss of work).
