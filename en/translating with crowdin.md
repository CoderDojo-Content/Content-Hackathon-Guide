# Translating with CrowdIn
Many of our translations use [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com), a website that lets you translate things line by line. We've loaded several different projects into it for this hackathon.

## Registering
In order contribute on CrowdIn you'll need to [register an account](https://crowdin.com/join). These are free. 

## Translating
Once you've registered, you'll just need to follow the links I've sent you to your project resources and start translating! If there are any issues, questions, etc. please contact me directly on Slack.
