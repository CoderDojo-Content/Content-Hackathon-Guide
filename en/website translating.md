# Translating the CoderDojo website

Even if you've only got a few minutes, you can help us out by translating parts of the CoderDojo website! Just [setup a CrowdIn account](https://crowdin.com/login) and follow [this link](https://crowdin.com/project/zen-community-platform) to the project page. 

You'll have to choose your language (if it's not there, slack me and I'll add it!) and then you'll see a list of files, along with their percentage of translation. Pick any file that is not 100% translated and start adding translations to the website!
